[[_ufw_rules_post]]
=== Insert new rule
....
POST /ufw/rules
....


==== Description
Add a new rule to the firewall.

Rule text is sent in the body of the request. 

*RULE SYNTAX*

Users can specify rules using either a simple syntax or a full syntax. The simple syntax only specifies the port and optionally the protocol to be allowed or denied on the host.

Example rules using the simple syntax: `allow 53`

This rule will allow tcp and udp port 53 to any address on the firewall host. To specify a protocol, append '/protocol' to the port.

Users can also use a fuller syntax, specifying the source and destination addresses and ports. This syntax is loosely based on OpenBSD's PF syntax. For example:

`deny proto tcp to any port 80`

This will deny all traffic to tcp port 80.

`deny proto tcp from 10.0.0.0/8 to 192.168.0.1 port 25`

This will deny all traffic from the RFC1918 Class A network to tcp port 25 with the address 192.168.0.1.
